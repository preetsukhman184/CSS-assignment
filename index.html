            Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl<br>
            Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world<br>
            Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies<br>
            My favorite rapper used to sing, "Check, check out my melody"<br>
            I wanna live good so, shit, I sell dope<br>
            For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes<br>
            Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat<br>
            If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope<br>
            Tossed and turned in my sleep that night<br>
            Woke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike<br>
            Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood<br>
            I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could<br>

        <p>Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
            And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop<br>
            Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P<br>
            And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me<br>
            Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top<br>
            And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop<br>
            Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P<br>
            And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me<br>
